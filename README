Squashfs-tools 4.5 released (2021-07-22)

GitHub

This is now the main development repository for Squashfs-Tools.

The kernel directories are obsolete, all kernel code is now in
mainline at www.kernel.org.

kernel-2.4: If you still need Squashfs support in the 2.4 kernel
then use the squashfs 3.2-r2 release.  This is the last release
that has a Mksquashfs which generates filesystems mountable with
Squashfs patched 2.4 kernels.  This release has patches for 2.4
kernels (but they have not been updated since the 3.1 release).
