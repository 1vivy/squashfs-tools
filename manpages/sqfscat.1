.SH NAME
sqfscat - tool to cat files from a squashfs filesystem to stdout
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sqfscat
[\fI\,OPTIONS\/\fR] \fI\,FILESYSTEM \/\fR[\fI\,files to cat\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux.
It uses either gzip/xz/lzo/lz4/zstd compression to compress both files, inodes
and directories.  Inodes in the system are very small and all blocks are
packed to minimise data overhead. Block sizes greater than 4K are supported
up to a maximum of 1Mbytes (default block size 128K).

Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival
use (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in constrained
block device/memory systems (e.g. embedded systems) where low overhead is
needed.

\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-version\fR
print version, licence and copyright information.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR NUMBER, \fB\-processors\fR NUMBER
use NUMBER processors.  By default will use the number of processors available.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR BYTES, \fB\-offset\fR BYTES
skip BYTES at start of FILESYSTEM. Optionally a suffix of K, M or G can be given to specify Kbytes, Mbytes or Gbytes respectively (default 0 bytes).
.TP

don't set exit code (to nonzero) on non\-fatal errors.
.TP
\fB\-da\fR SIZE, \fB\-data\-queue\fR SIZE
set data queue to SIZE Mbytes.  Default 256 Mbytes.
.TP
\fB\-fr\fR SIZE, \fB\-frag\-queue\fR SIZE
set fragment queue to SIZE Mbytes.  Default 256 Mbytes.
.TP
\fB\-no\-wild\fR, \fB\-no\-wildcards\fR
do not use wildcard matching in filenames.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-regex\fR
